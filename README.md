# Introduction to IoT - Temperature Prediction

Welcome to the **Introduction_to_IoT** repository! This project delves into the fascinating world of the Internet of Things (IoT) by demonstrating a 
practical application: the prediction of waterbody temperature using time series analysis. The project utilizes data from the Aquifer_Petrignano temperature 
sensors to forecast future temperature trends in the monitored waterbody.

## About

In the context of IoT, the project takes on the challenge of understanding and predicting environmental 
changes. The Aquifer_Petrignano sensor data serves as a valuable dataset for exploring how temperature variations in a waterbody can be analyzed 
over time. By leveraging time series analysis techniques, this project aims to provide a simple yet insightful demonstration of IoT applications 
in environmental monitoring.

## Key Components

### 1. Data

Explore the Aquifer_Petrignano sensor data in the `data` directory. This dataset forms the foundation for our 
temperature prediction analysis.

### 2. Notebooks
