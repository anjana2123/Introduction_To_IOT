# Introduction to IoT Basics

Welcome to the **Introduction_to_IoT_Basics** repository! This repository serves as an introduction to fundamental concepts in the 
Internet of Things (IoT). It encompasses two key tasks that explore different aspects of IoT applications.

## Task 1: Temperature Prediction

In the first task, we delve into the practical application of time series analysis for temperature prediction in a waterbody. 
The project utilizes data from the Aquifer_Petrignano temperature sensors to forecast future temperature trends. 
This task aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how IoT can be employed for environmental monitoring.

### Key Components

1. **Data**: Explore the Aquifer_Petrignano sensor data in the `data` directory, serving as the foundation for our temperature prediction analysis.

2. **Notebooks**: The Jupyter notebook `Temperature_Prediction.ipynb` contains the code for the time series analysis and temperature prediction, offering a step-by-step guide to understanding the process.

## Task 2: IoT Protocols and Architectures for Wearable Devices

In the second task, we shift our focus to the theoretical side of IoT by exploring protocols and architectures 
for wearable IoT devices. A paper, not yet published, has been prepared to delve into the intricacies of designing effective 
communication protocols and architectures for wearable IoT devices.

### Key Components

1. **Paper**: The paper, available in the `writeup...` directory, covers the exploration of IoT protocols and architectures tailored specifically for wearable devices.

## Getting Started

To dive into these tasks and explore IoT basics, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/anjana2123/Introduction_To_IoT.git`.

2. For Task 1, open and run the Jupyter notebook `Temperature_Prediction.ipynb` to witness the analysis and predictions in action.

3. For Task 2, explore the paper in the `Writeup` directory for insights into IoT protocols and architectures for wearable devices.
